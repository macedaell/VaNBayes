adam.R: The optimization algorithm for the neural network.
hetnorm2.R: Includes the initialization, loss function, and predictions for our variational posterior-- the heterogeneous marginal normal model.
simu_Dombry_et_al.R: Includes the functions used to generate data from the Brown-Resnick process
simulate_data.R: Generates the synthetic datasets from the training distribution.
run_brownresnick_GEV.R: Uses the synthetic data to train the neural networks, performs the simulation study, then saves the model results and graphs.
